## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend (StudentDashboard.js)

#### State Variables Added:

```javascript
const [selectedAnswers, setSelectedAnswers] = useState({});
const [submittingListening, setSubmittingListening] = useState(false);
```

#### Key Functions:

**1. handleListeningSubmission()**

- Validates all questions are answered
- Sends POST request to `/api/listening-exercises/:id/submit`
- Displays success message with score
- Clears answers and closes modal
- Refreshes progress data

**2. Answer Selection UI**

```javascript
<Radio.Group
  value={selectedAnswers[question._id]}
  onChange={(e) => {
    setSelectedAnswers({
      ...selectedAnswers,
      [question._id]: e.target.value,
    });
  }}
>
  {question.options.map((option, optIndex) => (
    <Radio key={optIndex} value={optIndex}>
      {String.fromCharCode(65 + optIndex)}. {option.text}
    </Radio>
  ))}
</Radio.Group>
```

**3. Modal Footer**

```javascript
<Button
  type="primary"
  icon={<CheckCircleOutlined />}
  loading={submittingListening}
  onClick={handleListeningSubmission}
  disabled={answersIncomplete}
>
  Submit Answers ({answered}/{total})
</Button>
```

## 🖥️ Backend Implementation

### Model: ListeningSubmission.js

Located: `server/models/ListeningSubmission.js`

**Schema Structure:**

```javascript
{
  exercise: ObjectId (ref: ListeningExercise),
  student: ObjectId (ref: User),
  answers: [{
    questionId: ObjectId,
    answer: Number (selected option index),
    isCorrect: Boolean,
    pointsEarned: Number
  }],
  score: Number,
  percentage: Number,
  submittedAt: Date,
  isCompleted: Boolean,
  attemptNumber: Number,
  timeSpent: Number (seconds),
  feedback: String,
  gradedBy: ObjectId,
  gradedAt: Date
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### 1. **Submit Exercise** (Student)

```
POST /api/listening-exercises/:id/submit
Auth: Required (any authenticated user)
Body: { answers: { questionId: selectedIndex, ... } }
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Submission recorded successfully",
  "submission": {
    /* full submission object */
  },
  "score": 4,
  "totalQuestions": 5,
  "percentage": 80,
  "attemptNumber": 1
}
```

**Grading Logic:**

1. Fetch exercise with all questions
2. Calculate attempt number (supports multiple attempts)
3. Loop through each question:
   - Find correct option index (where `option.isCorrect === true`)
   - Compare with student's answer
   - Mark as correct/incorrect
   - Award points (1 point per correct answer)
4. Calculate score and percentage
5. Save submission to database
6. Return results immediately

#### 2. **Get All Submissions** (Teacher)

```
GET /api/listening-exercises/:id/submissions
Auth: Required (faculty, admin, teacher)
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 15,
  "submissions": [
    {
      "student": { "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe", "email": "..." },
      "score": 4,
      "percentage": 80,
      "attemptNumber": 1,
      "submittedAt": "2025-10-13T10:30:00Z"
