# Quick Fix Summary: Listening Exercise Status Mismatch

## Problem

Teacher Dashboard showed all exercises as "Draft", but Student Dashboard showed them as "PUBLISHED".

## Root Cause

- Database uses `isPublished` (boolean) field
- Teacher Dashboard was looking for `status` (string) field that doesn't exist
- Result: Default "draft" shown for all exercises

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Fixed Status Column (Line ~1245)

```javascript
// Changed from "status" to "isPublished"
dataIndex: "isPublished";
render: (isPublished) => (
  <Tag color={isPublished ? "green" : "orange"}>
    {isPublished ? "Published" : "Draft"}
  </Tag>
);
```

### 2. Added Publish/Unpublish Button (Line ~1257)

```javascript
<Button
  type={record.isPublished ? "default" : "primary"}
  icon={record.isPublished ? <StopOutlined /> : <CheckCircleOutlined />}
  onClick={() => handleTogglePublishListening(record)}
>
  {record.isPublished ? "Unpublish" : "Publish"}
</Button>
```

### 3. Added Handler Function (Line ~928)

```javascript
const handleTogglePublishListening = async (exercise) => {
  // Toggle isPublished true/false
  // Send PUT request to API
  // Refresh table
};
```

## How to Use

### For Teachers:

1. Open Teacher Dashboard → Listening Exercises
2. Find exercise you want to publish
3. Click green **"Publish"** button
4. Exercise becomes visible to students

### To Unpublish:

1. Click gray **"Unpublish"** button on published exercise
2. Exercise becomes hidden from students
