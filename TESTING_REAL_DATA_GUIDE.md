# Testing Guide: Real Data Fetching in Teacher Dashboard

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

The Teacher Dashboard is now fully configured to fetch **real student submission data** from the database for listening exercises.

---

## 🔍 What's Already Implemented

### 1. **Real Data Fetching Function** (Line 874-902)

```javascript
const fetchListeningSubmissions = async (exerciseId) => {
  setSubmissionsLoading(true);
  try {
    const token =
      localStorage.getItem("authToken") || localStorage.getItem("token");
    const response = await fetch(
      `${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/api/listening-exercises/${exerciseId}/submissions`,
      {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
      }
    );

    if (response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json();
      console.log("📊 Fetched submissions:", data);
      setSubmissions(data.submissions || []);
    } else {
      message.error("Failed to fetch submissions");
      setSubmissions([]);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching submissions:", error);
    message.error("Error fetching submissions");
    setSubmissions([]);
  } finally {
    setSubmissionsLoading(false);
  }
};
```

### 2. **Submissions Button in Table** (Already added)

Each listening exercise row has a blue "Submissions" button that triggers the modal.

### 3. **Submissions Modal** (Already implemented)

Displays real data with:

- Statistics dashboard
- Submissions table
- Detailed view modal

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Start Both Servers

**Backend Server:**

```powershell
cd C:\SchoolWebsiteProject\forum-academy\server
npm run dev
```

**Frontend Client:**

```powershell
cd C:\SchoolWebsiteProject\forum-academy\client
npm start
```

### Step 2: Login as Teacher

1. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login with teacher credentials
3. Navigate to Dashboard

### Step 3: Navigate to Listening Exercises

1. Click on **"Listening Exercises"** tab
2. You should see a table with all listening exercises

### Step 4: Click "Submissions" Button

1. Find any listening exercise in the table
2. Click the **blue "Submissions" button** (with chart icon 📊)
3. A large modal should open

### Step 5: Verify Real Data is Displayed

**Check the Console:**

```
Open browser console (F12) and look for:
📊 Fetched submissions: { success: true, count: X, submissions: [...] }
```

**Check the Modal:**

- ✅ **Statistics Cards** should show real numbers (not 0):
  - Total Submissions
  - Average Score
  - Pass Rate
- ✅ **Submissions Table** should show actual student data:
  - Student names from your database
  - Real email addresses
  - Actual scores (e.g., 4/5)
  - Real percentages (e.g., 80%)
  - Actual submission timestamps

### Step 6: View Individual Submission

1. Click **"View Details"** button on any submission row
2. Nested modal opens showing:
   - Complete student information
   - Performance progress bar
   - Question-by-question breakdown with ✅/❌

---

## 🔍 Debugging: Verify Data is Real

### Check 1: Browser Network Tab

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Click "Submissions" button
4. Look for request:
   ```
   GET /api/listening-exercises/[exerciseId]/submissions
   Status: 200 OK
   ```
5. Click on the request → **Preview** tab
6. Verify response contains real data:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "count": 3,
     "submissions": [
       {
         "_id": "64abc...",
         "student": {
           "firstName": "John",
           "lastName": "Doe",
           "email": "john@example.com"
         },
         "score": 4,
         "percentage": 80,
         ...
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Check 2: Console Logs

Look for these console messages:

```
📊 Fetched submissions: {...}
```

If you see an empty array `[]`, it means:

- ✅ API is working correctly
- ℹ️ No students have submitted answers yet

### Check 3: MongoDB Database

Verify data exists in your database:

```javascript
// In MongoDB Compass or shell:
db.listeningsubmissions.find({}).pretty();
```

Should show documents like:

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "exercise": ObjectId("..."),
  "student": ObjectId("..."),
  "answers": [...],
  "score": 4,
  "percentage": 80,
  "submittedAt": ISODate("2025-10-13T10:30:00.000Z"),
  "attemptNumber": 1
}
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Scenario 1: Students HAVE Submitted

**Result:**

- ✅ Statistics show real numbers (Total: 3, Avg: 84%, Pass Rate: 100%)
- ✅ Table shows 3 rows with student names and scores
- ✅ "View Details" shows actual answers and results
- ✅ Console logs show actual data objects

### Scenario 2: NO Submissions Yet

**Result:**

- ✅ Statistics show zeros (Total: 0, Avg: 0%, Pass Rate: 0%)
- ✅ Table shows "No submissions yet" message
- ✅ Console logs: `📊 Fetched submissions: { success: true, count: 0, submissions: [] }`
- ℹ️ This is CORRECT behavior - no error!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Failed to fetch submissions" error

**Causes:**

- Backend server not running
- Wrong API URL in .env file
- Network connection issue

**Solutions:**

1. Verify backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`
2. Check `.env` file: `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`
3. Check browser console for detailed error

### Issue 2: Empty submissions array but students DID submit

**Causes:**

- Looking at wrong exercise
- Database connection issue
- Exercise ID mismatch

**Solutions:**

1. Verify exercise ID in API request (check Network tab)
2. Check MongoDB for submissions with that exercise ID
3. Verify backend logs for errors

### Issue 3: 401 Unauthorized error

**Causes:**

- Not logged in as teacher
- Token expired
- Wrong role permissions

**Solutions:**

1. Login again
2. Check localStorage has "authToken" or "token"
3. Verify user role is "teacher", "faculty", or "admin"

### Issue 4: Statistics show NaN

**Causes:**

- Submissions data structure mismatch
- Missing percentage field

**Solutions:**

1. Check console for actual data structure
2. Verify each submission has `percentage` field
3. Check calculations in component
