# Audio Playback Fix Deployment Guide

## Problem Fixed
- **Issue**: "Failed to load because no supported source was found" error when playing audio files
- **Cause**: Incorrect MIME type handling and CORS issues with Azure backend
- **Solution**: Enhanced MIME type detection and improved CORS headers

## Files Modified

### 1. Backend Controller: `server/controllers/listeningExerciseController.js`
**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced MIME type detection with file extension fallback
- Improved CORS headers for audio streaming
- Better error handling for GridFS file serving
- Fixed audio format compatibility for browsers

### 2. Backend Routes: `server/routes/listeningExerciseRoutes.js` 
**Changes Made:**
- Added test endpoints for debugging audio issues
- Enhanced CORS headers for audio requests
- Added HEAD method support for audio files

### 3. Frontend Component: `client/src/components/AdminFacultyDashboard.js`
**Changes Made:**
- Improved audio loading with timeout handling
- Added fallback blob-based audio loading
- Enhanced error reporting and debugging
- Better CORS handling for Azure compatibility

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Manual File Upload (Recommended)
1. **Access Azure Web App**:
   - Go to Azure Portal
   - Navigate to your Web App: `forum-backend-cnfrb6eubggucqda`
   - Go to "Development Tools" > "App Service Editor" or "Advanced Tools" > "Kudu"

2. **Upload Backend Files**:
   - Upload `server/controllers/listeningExerciseController.js`
   - Upload `server/routes/listeningExerciseRoutes.js`
   - Restart the Web App

3. **Deploy Frontend**:
   - The client changes are automatically deployed via GitHub Actions
   - Or manually deploy to Azure Static Web Apps

### Option 2: Git Deployment
```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix audio playback MIME type and CORS issues"
git push origin main

# Azure Web App will auto-deploy from connected repository
```

### Option 3: VS Code Azure Extension
1. Install Azure App Service extension
2. Right-click on server folder
3. Select "Deploy to Web App"
4. Choose your Web App

## Testing After Deployment

1. **Test Audio URL Directly**:
   ```
   https://forum-backend-cnfrb6eubggucqda.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net/api/listening-exercises/test-audio/{EXERCISE_ID}
   ```

2. **Test Audio File Directly**:
   ```
   https://forum-backend-cnfrb6eubggucqda.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net/api/listening-exercises/audio/{EXERCISE_ID}
   ```

3. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for improved error messages
   - Verify MIME type detection is working
   - Confirm CORS headers are properly set

## Expected Results

✅ **Before Fix**:
- Error: "Failed to load because no supported source was found"
- Network State: 3 (NETWORK_NO_SOURCE)
- Ready State: 0 (HAVE_NOTHING)

✅ **After Fix**:
- Proper MIME type detection (audio/mpeg, audio/wav, etc.)
- Successful audio loading and playback
- Better error messages if issues persist
- Fallback blob loading for problematic files

## Troubleshooting

If audio still doesn't work after deployment:

1. **Check Azure Web App Logs**:
   - Go to "Monitoring" > "Log stream" in Azure Portal
   - Look for audio-related error messages

2. **Verify File Upload**:
   - Try uploading a new MP3 file
   - Check if the test endpoint shows correct file info

3. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Test in different browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
   - Check browser console for detailed error messages

4. **Network Issues**:
   - Use browser Network tab to check response headers
   - Verify CORS headers are present in the response

## Manual File Update Commands

If you need to update files manually via Kudu console:

```bash
# Navigate to site folder
cd /home/site/wwwroot

# Backup current files
cp controllers/listeningExerciseController.js controllers/listeningExerciseController.js.backup
cp routes/listeningExerciseRoutes.js routes/listeningExerciseRoutes.js.backup

# Upload your updated files using the file manager
# Then restart the app
```

The key improvements include:
- Better MIME type detection for MP3, WAV, OGG files  
- Enhanced CORS headers for cross-origin audio requests
- Fallback audio loading strategies for problematic files
- Improved error handling and debugging information
