# Email Service Fix Applied

## âœ… **FIXED: nodemailer.createTransporter is not a function**

**Issue:** The error occurred because the correct NodeMailer method is `createTransport`, not `createTransporter`.

**What was fixed:**
- Changed `nodemailer.createTransporter` â†’ `nodemailer.createTransport` 
- Fixed in both production and development configurations
- Server is now running successfully

## ðŸ§ª **Email Service Status**

**Development Mode (Current):**
- Emails are logged to console for testing
- No actual emails sent (safe for development)
- All reply functionality works without sending real emails

**Production Mode Setup:**
Add these environment variables to enable real email sending:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
EMAIL_USER=your_gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
EMAIL_FROM=admissions@forumacademy.com
```

## ðŸ“§ **Testing the Reply System**

Your reply system is now fully functional:

1. **Server Status:** âœ… Running on port 5000
2. **Email Service:** âœ… Fixed and ready
3. **Reply Buttons:** âœ… Available in dashboard
4. **Development Mode:** âœ… Logs emails to console

**To test:**
1. Go to Admin Dashboard
2. Click "Reply" button on any contact message or application
3. Fill out the reply form
4. Click "Send Reply"
5. Check server console for email log output

## ðŸŽ‰ **Ready to Use!**

The reply functionality is now working correctly. In development mode, you'll see email content logged to the server console instead of sending actual emails, which is perfect for testing.

When you're ready for production, just add the email environment variables and the system will start sending real emails automatically!
