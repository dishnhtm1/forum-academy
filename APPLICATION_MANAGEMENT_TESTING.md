## üîß Key Technical Implementation

### Application Status Management
```javascript

  try {
    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:5000/api/applications/status/${id}`, {
      method: 'PATCH',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ status })
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      message.success(`Application ${status} successfully`);
      fetchApplications(); // Refresh data
    }
  } catch (error) {
    message.error('Failed to update application status');
  }
};
```

### Dynamic Action Buttons
- **Pending applications**: Show both "Approve" and "Reject" buttons
