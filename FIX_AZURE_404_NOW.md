## üß™ VERIFY IT WORKED

### Test 1: Check Available Routes
Open in browser:
```
https://forum-backend-cnfrb6eubggucqda.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net/api/health
```

**Look for these lines** in the response:
```json
{
  "routes": [
    "/api/zoom/*",           ‚Üê MUST BE HERE
    "/api/notifications/*",  ‚Üê MUST BE HERE
    "/api/progress/*"        ‚Üê MUST BE HERE
  ]
}
```

### Test 2: Test Zoom Endpoint
Open in browser:
```
https://forum-backend-cnfrb6eubggucqda.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net/api/zoom/meetings
```

**Should return** (auth error, NOT 404):
```json
{"message":"Access denied. Admin or teacher role required."}
```

**If you get 404**, deployment didn't work yet - wait another minute and retry.

## üì∏ What to Click (Visual Guide)

### In Azure Portal:
```
1. Search: "forum-backend-cnfrb6eubggucqda"
2. Click the App Service
3. Left sidebar ‚Üí "Deployment Center"
4. Top bar ‚Üí "Sync" button (big blue button)
5. Wait for "Deployment successful" message
```

---

## ‚ö° ALTERNATIVE: GitHub Actions (Manual Trigger)

If Azure Portal doesn't work:

1. Go to: https://github.com/dishnhtm1/forum-academy/actions
2. Click on **"Deploy Backend to Azure Web App"** workflow (left sidebar)
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button (right side)
4. Select branch: **master**
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

**NOTE**: This requires `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` secret to be set first.

## üîß If Still Not Working

### Check Environment Variables
1. In Azure Portal, go to your app
2. Click **"Configuration"** (left sidebar)
3. **Application settings** tab
4. Verify these exist:
   - `MONGO_URI`
   - `JWT_SECRET`
   - `CLIENT_URL`
   - `ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID`
   - `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID`
   - `ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET`

If any are missing, add them and restart the app.

### Check Logs
1. Click **"Log stream"** (left sidebar)
2. Look for errors during startup
3. Should see: `‚úÖ Zoom routes loaded`

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Result

After deployment:
- ‚úÖ No more 404 errors
- ‚úÖ Zoom meetings creation works
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking works
- ‚úÖ Notifications work
- ‚úÖ Announcements work

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Required
- **Sync deployment**: 2-3 minutes
- **First-time GitHub setup**: 10 minutes
- **Verification**: 30 seconds

---

## üÜò Still Stuck?

**Quick diagnostic**:

Run this in browser:
```
https://forum-backend-cnfrb6eubggucqda.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net/api/health
```

1. **If 404**: App is completely down - check Azure Portal for errors
2. **If returns JSON but no zoom routes**: Deployment didn't sync - try Sync button again
3. **If shows zoom routes**: Deployment worked! Clear your browser cache and retry

## üí° Why This Happened

Azure Web App does **NOT auto-deploy** when you push to GitHub unless:
1. Deployment Center is connected to GitHub, OR
2. GitHub Actions workflow is configured with proper secrets

Your code is perfect - it just needs to be deployed to Azure! üöÄ
